# Simple Dictionary
### WellCode - My third project
I created a Romanian - English dictionary. There are two buttons: one that adds to the list a word in Romanian and its translation into English from its above Input Text elements and another button that checks if the word from its above Searchbox element already exists or not in the list, displaying a message on the same page.
