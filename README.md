# Simple Dictionary
### WellCode - My third project
I created a Romanian - English dictionary. There are two buttons on the page: 
- the first button adds to the list a Romanian word and its English translation from the above Input Text elements; 
- the second button checks if the Romanian word from the above Searchbox element already exists or not in the list, displaying a message on the same page.
